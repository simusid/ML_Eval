# ML_Eval
Manages the evaluation of multiple machine learning models from multiple teams.

* create a challenge 
* define gold standard data for evaluation
* allow users to define a model submission (meta data)
* allow users to submit a model in Keras or Tensorflow format
* allow users to run evaluation
* present all results on web page
